<h2>About this Project</h2>
Unfortunately, the modding community and scene for the first KCD game never took off. 
</br></br>
To change this for KCD2, we need this community to work together to develop and share not just ideas, knowledge and experience, but also tools that make modding the game easier.
</br></br>
By making modding more achievable and lowering the barrier to entry, we can help to increase the quantity and quality of mods that are available.
</br></br>
This project aims to meet this requirement by providing a centralised location for those tools to exist.

<h2>Contributions</h2>
Contributions are welcomed and encouraged for this project.
</br></br>
To create a thriving modding community for KCD2, we need its members to share their knowledge, experience, and of course code!
</br></br>
Have you created something that you think might save other modders time, or that they might find useful? If so, <b>please consider submitting it in a pull request!</b>
